I walked up to the door of my grandfather's house and rang the bell. He happily opened the door and said: "Welcome, grandson!". I responded with "Thank you, happy birthday". He turned 80 today and has had serious vision issues lately. I remember he read book after book 25 years ago, but his passion is in serious danger now.
I was greeted by my younger sister Jane as I entered the hallway "Hello, brother!". As I hugged her I heard my father shouting angrily "Grandfather really must find something fun to do!".
My mother replied with a sad undertone "He just can't read any books anymore". I quickly entered the living room and said "Don't worry everyone, I have the perfect solution".
My older sister asked "What can that be?". I explained proudly "I found this new technology that can automatically turn any book into an amazing audiobook!".
"Grandfather will be able to listen to any book he wishes!" said Jane. Grandfather answer relieved "That would be absolutely amazing".
